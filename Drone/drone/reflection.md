# Reflection & Design Justification

---

## üß± Architecture Overview

The project is organized into clean, testable modules:

- **data_loader.py** ‚Äì Parses primary and simulated missions from JSON.
- **conflict_checker.py** ‚Äì Handles all spatial + temporal deconfliction logic.
- **interface.py** ‚Äì Exposes a callable interface for conflict query.
- **visualizer.py** ‚Äì Uses Matplotlib to plot paths and highlight conflicts.
- **main.py** ‚Äì Entry point that wires up the data, logic, and output.

This modular approach enables easy testing, visualization, and potential integration with real-world systems.

## üß† Conflict Detection Logic

- **Spatial Check**: Euclidean distance between waypoints is compared against a configurable `SAFETY_RADIUS` (e.g., 10m).
- **Temporal Check**: Uses overlapping intervals (e.g., `[11‚Äì20]`) to verify whether drones are simultaneously in conflict space.
- **Conflict Report**: Provides readable, indexed output explaining the source and timing of each detected conflict.

---

## üß™ Testing Strategy

- Multiple runs tested with overlapping and non-overlapping mission profiles.
- Created isolated test functions to verify `spatial_conflict` and `temporal_overlap`.
- Tested performance with multiple drones and long waypoint chains.

## ü§ñ AI Tool Integration

This project was assisted using **ChatGPT** and claud for best outcomes:

- ‚úÖ Code skeleton and modular structure were scaffolded quickly
- ‚úÖ Import resolution and packaging problems were debugged interactively
- ‚úÖ Visualization ideas and enhancements (e.g., animations, Plotly) were suggested

These tools significantly reduced development time and helped maintain clean structure.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Scalability & Real-World Deployment

If scaled to handle **tens of thousands of commercial drones**, the following architectural enhancements would be essential:

- **Data Ingestion**:
  - Use Apache Kafka to stream real-time drone telemetry.
  - Store historic paths in a time-series database like InfluxDB or TimescaleDB.

- **Processing**:
  - Use Dask or Apache Flink for distributed conflict checking.
  - Implement spatial partitioning (e.g., quadtrees) to reduce conflict check overhead.

- **Interface/API**:
  - Convert the CLI into a RESTful API using FastAPI.
  - Deploy behind a load balancer with horizontal autoscaling.

- **Visualization**:
  - Used Plotly Dash for real-time 3D + time-based visualization in browsers.

---  This project includes an interactive time-based animation using Plotly. The animation:

    Visually shows the movement of the primary and simulated drones over time

    Animates each drone's path based on their assigned timestamp intervals

    Displays each time step with a slider and ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù button in the browser

    Can be exported and shared as an HTML file

## üéØ Final Thoughts

The assignment was an excellent test of combining:

- Spatiotemporal logic
- Visual thinking
- Modular programming
- Real-world aviation safety challenges

With AI tools, a complex problem was made tractable and interactive ‚Äî allowing deeper focus on logic and architecture.
